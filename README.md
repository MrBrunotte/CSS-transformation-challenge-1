# CSS Transformation challenge 1

Make an <em>image</em> double in size when you hover over it but don't make it jump.
Use a transition to make the transformation smooth.
The transformation should happen within 1 second, and the transition-timing-function
should be set to ease-in.


### What I learned here

I tried to target an element as a class in my css file. I hade put the picture of the bear
as an element and when I tired to target it from my css file with .img id didnt work!

When I changed the bear picture link and put it in a class:

        <body>
            <img class="img" src="https://placebear.com/cache/145-201.jpg" alt="Image of a bear" />
        </body>
        
It worked and I got the challenge to work!

I also learned a lot from inspecting my page, I could see that there was something wrong and most important
what to look for!

Good challenge that gave me new understanding!
